# graph-tool practice

notes about how to format this:

do we want a dynamic action space, or do we want a fixed action space, with a function that gives a boolean after on whether or not a selected action is valid for that state?

if we do dynamic: slightly harder to code initially but could be faster

if we do boolean: easier to code action space, potentially slower, but could be better mathematically?
